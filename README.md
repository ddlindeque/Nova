## Journey

There is *obviously* scope to optimise every single component, at any level, of this design. This design aims to show we can build a computer from basic components (if we were to have done it the first time around)

* Build *gates* from transisitors (and other gates). See 'gates' directory
* Buld ALU from *gates. See 'alu' directory
